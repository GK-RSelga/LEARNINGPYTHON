# Student Records and Data Management System


## Objective
This project was designed and developed using Python code functions to manage student records. It allows users to create and store student information, including names, the number of students, grades for each subject, average scores with pass or fail results, and unique subjects with unique subjects offered results. The program simplifies record keeping and assists users in displaying and maintaining student data.

## Features

 - Easy to Code
 - High-Level Programming Language
 - Users can store student name, grades, average score and results, and unique subjects
 - Users can display the studentâ€™s list, subjectâ€™s grades, average score with pass or fail result.
 - The program is manageable if the user wants to create a student list to its desired required count.
 - The program is manageable if the user wants to create a subject with grades input to its desired required count.
 - The program is manageable if the user wants to create a unique subjectâ€™s input with unique subjects offered results to its desired required count.

## Instructions on How to Run the Program
Open the installed Visual Studio Code, make sure that the Python is already set up in Visual Studio Code and the extension was already installed.
Please download or copy the (.py) file on the Github repo, after the download, open the file or press CTRL + O from your Visual Studio Code and select the (.py) Student Records file. For further demonstration see the provided demo links.

## Limitations and Possible Future Improvements
The program's possible future improvements can focus on using and creating student records as
dictionaries or nested lists to enhance the efficiency of data and information management.
